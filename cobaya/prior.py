:Synopsis: Class containing the prior and reference pdf, and other parameter information.
:Author: Jesus Torrado


Basic parameter specification
-----------------------------

The ``params`` block contains all the information intrinsic
to the parameters of the model: their prior pdf and reference pdf, their latex labels,
and useful properties for particular samplers (e.g. width of a proposal pdf in an MCMC
-- see the documentation for each sampler).
The prior and reference pdf are managed by the :class:`Prior` class.

You can specify three different kinds of parameters:

+ **Fixed** parameters are specified by assigning them a value, and are passed directly to
  the likelihood or theory code.
+ **Sampled** parameters need a ``prior`` pdf definition and, optionally,
  a reference pdf (``ref``),
  a LaTeX label to be used when producing plots,
  and additional properties to aid particular samplers.
+ **Derived** parameters do **not** have a prior definition
  (neither a reference value or pdf),
  but can have a LaTeX label and a ``min`` and/or ``max``
  to be used in the sample analysis
  (e.g. to guess the pdf tails correctly if the derived quantity needs to be positive or
  negative -- defaulted to ``-.inf``, ``.inf`` resp.).

The (optional) **reference** pdf (``ref``) for **sampled** parameters defines the region
of the prior which is of most interest (e.g. where most of the prior mass is expected);
samplers needing an initial point for a chain will attempt to draw it from the ``ref``
if it has been defined (otherwise from the prior). A good reference pdf will avoid a long
*burn-in* stage during the sampling. If you assign a single value to ``ref``, samplers
will always start from that value; however this makes convergence tests less reliable as
each chain will start from the same point (so all chains could be stuck near the same
point).

.. note::

   When running in parallel with MPI you can give ``ref`` different values for each of
   the different parallel processes (either at initialisation or by calling
   :func:`Prior.set_reference`). They will be taken into account e.g. for starting
   parallel MCMC chains at different points/distributions of your choice.

The syntax for priors and ref's has the following fields:

+ ``dist`` (default: ``uniform``): any 1-dimensional continuous distribution from
  `scipy.stats <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#continuous-distributions>`_;
  e.g. ``uniform``, ``[log]norm`` for a [log-]gaussian,
  or ``halfnorm`` for a half-gaussian.
+ ``loc`` and ``scale`` (default: 0 and 1, resp.): the *location* and *scale* of the pdf,
  as they are understood for each particular pdf in :class:`scipy.stats`; e.g. for a
  ``uniform`` pdf, ``loc`` is the lower bound and ``scale`` is the length of the domain,
  whereas in a gaussian (``norm``) ``loc`` is the mean and ``scale`` is the standard
  deviation.
+ Additional specific parameters of the distribution, e.g. ``a`` and ``b`` as the powers
  of a Beta pdf.

.. note::

   For bound distributions (e.g. ``uniform``, ``beta``...), you can use the more
   intuitive arguments ``min`` and ``max`` (default: 0 and 1 resp.) instead of ``loc`` and
   ``scale`` (NB: unexpected behaviour for an unbounded pdf).


The order of the parameters is conserved in the table of samples, except that
derived parameters are always moved to the end.

An example ``params`` block:

.. code-block :: yaml

     params:

       A: 1 # fixed!

       B1:  # sampled! with uniform prior on [-1,1] and ref pdf N(mu=0,sigma=0.25)
         prior:
           min: -1
           max:  1
         ref:
           dist: norm
           loc:   0
           scale: 0.25
         latex: \mathcal{B}_2
         proposal: 0.25

       B2:  # sampled! with prior N(mu=0.5,sigma=3) and fixed reference value 1
         prior:
           dist: norm
           loc: 0.5
           scale: 3
         ref: 1  # fixed reference value: all chains start here!
         latex: \mathcal{B}_2
         proposal: 0.5

       C:  # derived!
         min: 0
         latex: \mathcal{C}

You can find another basic example :ref:`here <example_quickstart_shell>`.


.. _prior_external:

Multidimensional priors
-----------------------

The priors described above are obviously 1-dimensional.
You can also define more complicated, multidimensional priors
using a ``prior`` block at the base level (i.e. not indented), as in the
:ref:`the advanced example <example_advanced_shell>`. All the details below also apply to
the definition of :ref:`external likelihoods <likelihood_external>`. We will call these
custom priors "`external` priors".

Inside the ``prior`` block, list a pair of priors as ``[name]: [function]``, where the
functions must return **log**-priors. These priors will be multiplied by the
one-dimensional ones defined above. Even if you define a prior for some parameters
in the ``prior`` block, you still have to specify their bounds in the ``params`` block.

A prior function can be specified in two different ways:

a) **As a function**, either assigning a function defined with ``def``, or a ``lambda``.
   Its arguments must be known parameter names.

b) **As a string,** which will be passed to ``eval()``. The string can be a
   ``lambda`` function definition with known parameters as its arguments (you can
   use ``scipy.stats`` and  ``numpy`` as ``stats`` and ``np`` resp.), or an
   ``import_module('filename').function`` statement if your function is defined in a
   separate file ``filename`` `in the current folder` and is named ``function``
   (see e.g. :ref:`the advanced example <example_advanced_shell>`).

.. note::

   Your function definition may contain keyword arguments that aren't known parameter
   names. They will simply be ignored and left to their default.

.. warning::

   When **resuming** a run using an **external** python object as input (e.g. a prior or a
   likelihood), there is no way for Cobaya to know whether the new object is the same as
   the old one: it is left to the user to ensure reproducibility of those objects between
   runs.

.. warning::

   External priors can only be functions **sampled** and **fixed**
   and **derived** parameters that are dynamically defined in terms of other inputs.
   Derived parameters computed by the theory code cannot be used in a prior, since
   otherwise the full prior could not be computed **before** the likelihood,
   preventing us from avoiding computing the likelihood when the prior is null, or
   forcing a *post-call* to the prior.

   **Workaround:** Define your function as a
   :ref:`external likelihood <likelihood_external>` instead, since likelihoods do have
   access to derived parameters (for an example, see `this comment
   <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya/issues/18#issuecomment-447818811>`_).


Prior normalization for evidence computation
--------------------------------------------

The one-dimensional priors defined within the ``params`` block are automatically
normalized, so any sampler that computes the evidence will produce the right results as
long as no external priors have been defined, whose normalization is unknown.

To get the prior normalization if using external functions as priors, you can substitute
your likelihood by the :doc:`dummy unit likelihood <likelihood_one>`, and make an initial
run with :doc:`PolyChord <sampler_polychord>` to get the prior volume
(see section :ref:`polychord_bayes_ratios`).

In general, avoid improper priors, since they will produce unexpected errors, e.g.

.. code-block:: yaml

    params:
      a:
        prior:
          min: -.inf
          max:  .inf


.. _repar:

Defining parameters dynamically
-------------------------------

We may want to sample in a parameter space different from the one understood by the
likelihood, e.g. because we expect the posterior to be simpler on the alternative
parameters.

For instance, in the :doc:`advanced example <example_advanced>`, the posterior on the
radius and the angle is a gaussian times a uniform, instead of a more complicated
gaussian ring. This is done in a simple way at
:ref:`the end of the example <example_advanced_rtheta>`.
Let us discuss the general case here.

To enable this, **cobaya** creates a `re-parameterization` layer between the `sampled`
parameters, and the `input` parameters of the likelihood. E.g. if we want to **sample**
from the logarithm of an **input** parameter of the likelihood, we would do:

.. code:: yaml

    params:
      logx:
        prior: [...]
        drop: True
      x: "lambda logx: np.exp(logx)"
      y:
        derived: "lambda x: x**2"

When that information is loaded **cobaya** will create an interface between two sets of
parameters:

+ **Sampled** parameters, i.e. those that have a prior, including ``logx`` but not ``x``
  (it does not have a prior: it's fixed by a function). Those are the ones with which the
  **sampler** interacts. Since the likelihood does not understand them, they must be
  **dropped** with ``drop: True`` if you are using any parameter-agnostic components.

+ Likelihood **input** parameters: those that will be passed to the likelihood
  (or theory). They are identified by either having a prior and not being **dropped**, or
  having being assigned a fixed value or a function. Here, ``x`` would be an input
  parameter, but not ``logx``.

.. _cobaya_diagram:
.. image:: ./img/diagram.svg
   :align: center
   :width: 60%

We can use a similar approach to define dynamical **derived** parameters, which can depend
on *input* and *sampled* parameters. To distinguish their notation from that of input
parameters, we insert the functions defining them under a ``derived`` property
(see the parameter ``y`` in the example above).

.. note::

   **Dynamical derived** parameters can also be functions of yet-undefined parameters.
   In that case, those parameters will be automatically requested from the likelihood (or
   theory code) that understands them.

.. note::

   Also available are the :math:`\chi^2 = -2 \log \mathcal{L}` of the used likelihoods,
   as `chi2__[name]`, e.g.

   .. code:: yaml

     likelihood:
       my_like: [...]
     params:
       my_derived:
         derived: "lambda chi2__my_like: [...]"

.. note::

   By default, the values of **dynamical input** parameters (e.g. ``x`` above) are saved
   as if they were derived parameters. If you would like to ignore them, define them using
   the following *extended notation*:

   .. code:: yaml

      params:
        x:
          value: "lambda logx: np.exp(logx)"
          derived: False

.. note::

   If you want to fix the value of a parameter whose only role is being an argument of a
   dynamically defined one and is *not supposed to be passed to the likelihood*, you need
   to explicitly *drop* it. E.g. suppose that you want to sample from a likelihood that
   depends on ``x``, but want to use ``log(x)`` as the sampled parameter; you would do it
   like this:

   .. code:: yaml

      params:
        logx:
          prior: [...]
          drop: True
        x:
          value: "lambda logx: np.exp(x)"

   Now, if you want to fix the value of ``logx`` without changing the structure of the
   input, do

   .. code:: yaml

      params:
        logx:
          value: [fixed_value]
          drop: True
        x:
          value: "lambda logx: np.exp(x)"


.. _prior_inheritance:

Changing and redefining parameters; inheritance
-----------------------------------------------

As we will see in the :doc:`likelihoods documentation <likelihoods>`, just by mentioning a
likelihood, the parameters of its default experimental model are
inherited without needing to re-state them.

But you may want to fix their value, re-define their prior or some other property in
your input file. To do that, simply state you new parameter definition as you would
normally do. For your convenience, if you do that, you don't need to re-state all of the
properties of the parameters (e.g. the latex label if just changing the prior).

As a general rule, when trying to redefine anything in a parameter, everything not
re-defined is inherited, except for the prior, which must not be inheritable in order to
allow re-defining sampled parameters into something else.

Just give it a try and it should work fine, but, in case you need the details:

* Re-defining **fixed** into:

 - **fixed**: simply assign it a new value
 - **sampled**: define a prior for it (and optionally reference, label, etc.)
 - **derived**: mention the parameter and assign nothing to it (you may define a
   min, max or latex label, but *not a prior*)

* Re-defining **sampled** into:

 - **fixed**: simply assign it a value
 - **sampled**: change any of prior/ref/latex, etc, to your taste; the rest are inherited
   from the defaults
 - **derived**: mention the parameter and assign nothing to it (you may define a
   min, max or latex label, but *not a prior*; the label is inherited from the defaults)

* Re-defining **derived** into:

 - **fixed**: simply assign it a value
 - **sampled**: define a prior for it (and optionally reference, label, etc.)
 - **derived**: change any of prior/ref/latex, etc, to your taste; the rest are inherited
   from the defaults

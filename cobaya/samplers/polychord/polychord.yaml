# Default arguments for the PolyChord sampler

# Path to the PolyChord installation folder, if not installed with cobaya-install,
# or 'global' to force global-scope import
path:  # use only if installed manually!
# Optional parameters for the sampler:
# ('Xd' means 'X steps per dimension')
# -------------------------------------------------
# Number of live points
nlive: 25d
# Number of slice-sampling steps each new sample.
# Helps with curved degeneracies and thin "corners".
# Recommended: '5d' if accurate evidences needed or weird posterior shapes.
# You may want to use `d` for exploratory runs.
num_repeats: 2d
# Number of prior samples drawn before starting compression
# Can be in units of nlive (but not dimension) as Xnlive
nprior: 10nlive
# Number of failed spawns before stopping nested sampling.
nfail : nlive
# Whether to check for and explore multi-modality on the posterior
do_clustering: True
# Stopping criterion: fraction of the total evidence contained in the live points
precision_criterion: 0.001
# Stopping criterion (alt): maximum number of nested sampling iterations
max_ndead: .inf
# How often to print progress, update output files and do clustering
# -- increase for more frequency (1 for update and callback per dead point)
compression_factor: 0.36787944117144233  # = exp(-1)
# Callback function -- see documentation
callback_function:
# Numerical value of log(0) sent to PolyChord's Fortran code
# If null: `numpy.nan_to_num(-numpy.inf)`
# NB: smaller values tend to produce errors when using `ifort`
logzero: -1e30
# Increase number of posterior samples
boost_posterior: 0  # increase up to `num_repeats`
# Verbosity during the sampling process. Set to one of [0,1,2,3]
feedback:  # default: Same as global `verbosity`
# Parallelise with synchronous workers, rather than asynchronous ones.
# This can be set to False if the likelihood speed is known to be
# approximately constant across the parameter space. Synchronous
# parallelisation is less effective than asynchronous by a factor ~O(1)
# for large parallelisation.
synchronous : True
# Variable number of live points option. This dictionary is a mapping
# between loglike contours and nlive.
# You should still set nlive to be a sensible number, as this indicates
# how often to update the clustering, and to define the default value.
nlives : {}
# Perform maximisation at the end of the run to find the maximum
# likelihood point and value
maximise : False
# Exploiting speed hierarchy
# --------------------------
# whether to measure actual speeds for your machine/threading at starting rather
# than using stored values
measure_speeds: True
# Amount of oversampling of each parameter block, relative to their speeds
# Value from 0 (no oversampling) to 1 (spend the same amount of time in all blocks)
# Can be larger than 1 if extra oversampling of fast blocks required.
oversample_power: 0.4
# Manual speed blocking
# ---------------------
# To take full advantage of speed-blocking, sort the blocks by ascending speeds
# (unless not possible due to the architecture of your likelihood)
blocking:
#  - [speed_1, [params_1]]
#  - etc.
# Treatment of unbounded parameters: confidence level to use
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# (Use with care if there are likelihood modes close to the edge of the prior)

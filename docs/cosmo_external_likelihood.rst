Creating your own cosmological likelihood
=========================================

Creating your own cosmological likelihood with **cobaya** is super simple. You can either define a likelihood class (see :doc:`cosmo_external_likelihood_class`),
or here we simply make a likelihood function:

#. Define your likelihood as a function that takes some parameters (experimental errors, foregrounds, etc, but **not theory** parameters) and returns a log-likelihood.
#. Take note of the observables and other cosmological quantities that you will need to request from the theory code. Look them up in the :func:`~theories.BoltzmannBase.BoltzmannBase.needs` (clickable!) method documentation. *[If you cannot find the observable that you need, do let us know!]*
#. Add to your likelihood function definition a keyword argument named ``_theory``, and assign to it all the cosmological requirements as a **dictionary** (e.g. ``_theory={'cl': {'tt': 2500}}``).
#. Now you can get theory products inside your function calling the ``get_[...]`` methods of the :class:`cosmo interface <theories.BoltzmannBase.BoltzmannBase>` (clickable!) as e.g ``_theory.get_Cl()``. The value of the theory products corresponds to the current set of theory parameter values that were generated by the sampler.
#. To include your likelihood in the input info or ``yaml`` file, or to add derived parameters, do it as for :ref:`general external likelihoods <likelihood_external>` (example :doc:`here <example_advanced>`).


Example: your own CMB experiment!
---------------------------------

To illustrate how to create a cosmological likelihood in **cobaya**, we apply the procedure above to a fictitious WMAP-era full-sky CMB TT experiment.

First of all, we will need to simulate the fictitious power spectrum of the fictitious sky that we would measure with our fictitious experiment, once we have accounted for noise and beam corrections. To do that, we choose a set of *true* cosmological parameters in the sky, and then use a :class:`model` to compute the corresponding power spectrum, up to some reasonable :math:`\ell_\mathrm{max}` (see :doc:`cosmo_model`).

.. code:: python

   fiducial_params = {
       'ombh2': 0.022, 'omch2': 0.12, 'H0': 68, 'tau': 0.07,
       'As': 2.2e-9, 'ns': 0.96,
       'mnu': 0.06, 'nnu': 3.046, 'num_massive_neutrinos': 1}

   l_max = 1000

   packages_path = '/path/to/your/packages'

   info_fiducial = {
       'params': fiducial_params,
       'likelihood': {'one': None},
       'theory': {'camb': None},
       'packages': packages_path}

   from cobaya.model import get_model
   model_fiducial = get_model(info_fiducial)

   # Declare our desired theory product
   # (there is no cosmological likelihood doing it for us)
   model_fiducial.theory.needs(Cl={'tt': l_max})

   # Compute and extract the CMB power spectrum
   # (In muK^-2, without l(l+1)/(2pi) factor)
   # notice the empty dictionary below: all parameters are fixed
   model_fiducial.logposterior({})
   Cls = model_fiducial.theory.get_Cl(ell_factor=False)

   # Our fiducial power spectrum
   Cl_est = Cls['tt'][:l_max+1]


Now, let us define the likelihood. The arguments of the likelihood function will contain the parameters that we want to vary (arguments not mentioned later in an input info will be left to their default, e.g. ``beam_FWHM=0.25``). As mentioned above, there are two special keywords:

+ ``_theory``:

  - **In the function declaration**, use it to name the theory products that you will need. To do that, set it to a dictionary containing the relevant arguments of the theory method :func:`~theories.BoltzmannBase.BoltzmannBase.needs` (clickable!).
  - **Inside the function**, assume it's an instance of your theory code, and simply call its methods as needed to get observables and parameters.

+ ``_derived``:

  - **In the function declaration**, set it to a dictionary whose keys are the 'available' derived params.
  - **Inside the function**, assume that you have been passed an existing dictionary and add to it the derived parameters with their value.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   def my_like(
           # Parameters that we may sample over (or not)
           noise_std_pixel=20,  # muK
           beam_FWHM=0.25,  # deg
           # Declaration of our theory requirements
           _theory={'cl': {'tt': l_max}},
           # Declaration of available derived parameters
           _derived=('Map_Cl_at_500',)):
       # Noise spectrum, beam-corrected
       healpix_Nside=512
       pixel_area_rad = np.pi/(3*healpix_Nside**2)
       weight_per_solid_angle = (noise_std_pixel**2 * pixel_area_rad)**-1
       beam_sigma_rad = beam_FWHM / np.sqrt(8*np.log(2)) * np.pi/180.
       ells = np.arange(l_max+1)
       Nl = np.exp((ells*beam_sigma_rad)**2)/weight_per_solid_angle
       # Cl of the map: data + noise
       Cl_map = Cl_est + Nl
       # Cl from theory: treat '_theory' as a 'theory code instance'
       Cl_theo = _theory.get_Cl(ell_factor=False)['tt'][:l_max+1]  # muK-2
       Cl_map_theo = Cl_theo + Nl
       # Set our derived parameter, assuming '_derived' is a dictionary
       if isinstance(_derived, dict):
           _derived['Map_Cl_at_500'] = Cl_map[500]
       # Auxiliary plot
       #ell_factor = ells*(ells+1)/(2*np.pi)
       #plt.figure()
       #plt.plot(ells[2:], (Cl_theo*ell_factor)[2:], label=r'Theory $C_\ell$')
       #plt.plot(ells[2:], (Cl_est*ell_factor)[2:], label=r'Estimated $C_\ell$')
       #plt.plot(ells[2:], (Cl_map*ell_factor)[2:], label=r'Map $C_\ell$')
       #plt.plot(ells[2:], (Nl*ell_factor)[2:], label='Noise')
       #plt.legend()
       #plt.ylim([0, 6000])
       #plt.show()
       #plt.close()
       # ----------------
       # Compute the log-likelihood
       V = Cl_map[2:]/Cl_map_theo[2:]
       return np.sum((2*ells[2:]+1)*(-V/2 +1/2.*np.log(V)))


Now we are ready to do something with it. Since our imaginary experiment isn't very powerful, we will refrain from trying to estimate the full :math:`\Lambda` CDM parameter set. We may focus instead e.g. on the primordial power spectrum parameters :math:`A_s` and :math:`n_s`, and assume that we magically have accurate values for the rest of the cosmological parameters.

To illustrate the use of likelihood parameters, we will try to marginalise over some uncertainty on the noise standard deviation. We will also get the derived parameter defined in the likelihood: map power spectrum at :math:`\ell=500`.

.. code:: python

   info = {
       'params': {
           # Fixed
           'ombh2': 0.022, 'omch2': 0.12, 'H0': 68, 'tau': 0.07,
           'mnu': 0.06, 'nnu': 3.046, 'num_massive_neutrinos': 1,
           # Sampled
           'As': {'prior': {'min': 1e-9, 'max': 4e-9}, 'latex': 'A_s'},
           'ns': {'prior': {'min': 0.9, 'max': 1.1}, 'latex': 'n_s'},
           'noise_std_pixel': {
               'prior': {'dist': 'norm', 'loc': 20, 'scale': 5},
               'latex': r'\sigma_\mathrm{pix}'},
           # Derived
           'Map_Cl_at_500': {'latex': r'C_{500,\,\mathrm{map}}'}},
       'likelihood': {'my_cl_like': my_like},
       'theory': {'camb': {'stop_at_error': True}},
       'sampler': {'mcmc': None},  # or polychord...
       'packages_path': packages_path,
       'output': 'chains/my_imaginary_cmb'}


But first of all, we will test it using a :class:`Model`:

.. code:: python

   # Activate timing (we will use it later)
   info['timing'] = True

   from cobaya.model import get_model
   model = get_model(info)


And now we can e.g. plot a slice of the log likelihood along different :math:`A_s` values:

.. code:: python

   As = np.linspace(1e-9, 4e-9, 10)
   likes = [model.loglike({'As': A, 'ns': 0.96, 'noise_std_pixel': 20})[0] for A in As]

   plt.figure()
   plt.plot(As, likes)
   plt.show()


.. note::

   **Troubleshooting:**

   If you are not getting the expected value for the likelihood, here are a couple of thing that you can try:

   - Set ``debug: True`` in the input, which will cause **cobaya** to print much more information, e.g. the parameter values are passed to the prior, the theory code and the likelihood.
   - If the likelihood evaluates to ``-inf`` (but the prior is finite) it probably means that either the theory code or the likelihood are failing; to display the error information of the theory code, add to it the ``stop_at_error: True`` option, as shown in the example input above, and the same for the likelihood, if it is likely to throw errors.


Before we start sampling, it is a good idea to characterize the speed of your likelihood, so that the sampler can behave more efficiently. To do that, set ``timing: True`` in the input before initialising your model (as we did above), evaluate the likelihood a couple of times (as we did for the log-likelihood plot above), and *close* the model as ``model.close()``. This will print the evaluation time (in seconds) of the theory code and the likelihoods. Now, redefine the likelihood in the input to add the speed, which is the inverse of the evaluation time in seconds, e.g. if that was :math:`2\,\mathrm{ms}`:

.. code:: python

   info['likelihood']['my_cl_like'] = {
       'external': my_like,
       'speed': 500}


Now we can start sampling. To do that, you can save all the definitions above in a ``.py`` file, that you will run directly with ``python``. You will need to add the following lines at the end:

.. code:: python

   from cobaya.run import run
   run(info)

.. note::

    For the moment you must make a new info dictionary to call cobaya.run, you cannot reuse the same info previously used to call get_model for testing.

Alternatively, specially if you are planning to share your likelihood, you can put its definition (including the fiducial spectrum, maybe saved as a table separately) in a separate file, say ``my_like_file.py``. In this case, to use it, use ``import_module([your_file_without_extension]).your_function``, here

.. code:: yaml

   # Contents of some .yaml input file
   likelihood:
       some_name:
           external: import_module('my_like_file').my_like
           speed: 500

External likelihoods
======================

This page lists external Python modules that can be used with Cobaya. For how to write your own package see :doc:`cosmo_external_likelihood_class`.

After installing an external package, when running Cobaya reference your likelihood in the form ``[package or module name].ClassName``. For example, if your ExternalLike class is in a module called ``newlike`` your input .yaml would be

.. code:: yaml

    likelihood:
      newlike.ExternalLike:
         python_path: /path/to/newlike
         # .. any parameters you want to override

The python_path is not needed if the package has been pip installed.

List of external likelihoods
============================

Here is a non-extensive list of external likelihoods, i.e. likelihoods not
integrated in the Cobaya cosmo package, and generally not authored by the main
Cobaya developers. Clicking on their name will take you to their homepage
for further documentation.

All this likelihoods can be used just by mentioning them in an input file, and can
be installed with ``cobaya-install [name]`` or ``cobaya-install [input.yaml]``
(otherwise please submit an issue [LINK]).

You can have your likelihood listed here by submitting a PR/ISSUE in the Cobaya
cosmo package [LINK].
